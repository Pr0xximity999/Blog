                <p class="newlineOnEnter">
                    It all started when a friend of mine showed me a website he found.
                    The website in question being <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dimden.dev">dimden's website.</a>
                    <img class="blogImg" src="https://i.imgur.com/6jImevH.png" onclick="window.open('https://www.dimden.dev')">
                    <a class="centered">The website in question^</a>
                    This page really inspired me to make my own.

                    So i decided to make my own. <br>
                    I looked for some hosting options and discovered that you can host a github repository.
                    <img style="width: 15em; " src="Attachments/screenshot 1.png">
                    <a class="">In the settings of a repository you have this button to lead to your pages settings</a>
                    In this page are a whole lot of settings with which you can set up the website.

                    Now this webpage normally has a set domain name, something like [github_username].pages.github.io or something.
                    Yeah i didnt want that.
                    So i paid for a custom domain, the one in the url bar right now, <a href="https://tominhisroom.dev">tominhisroom.dev</a>
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>>A blank slate</h2>
                <p class="newlineOnEnter">
                    Of course this website didnt start out the way you see it here.
                    It started out as this.
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 2.png">
                    <a>A blank slate</a>
                    Nothing, not even some text.

                    So i did just that and added something :3
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 3.png">
                    
                </p>
                <h3>>After this i tried to make the url actually work, which took like 2 days to do since i screwed myself over by using a .dev domain..</h3>
                <p class="newlineOnEnter">
                    Most domains can be connected with via both <b>HTTP</b> and <b>HTTPS</b>.
                    With .dev sites you can only connect over <b>HTTPS</b>.
                    Now you might be wondering, so why is this annoying?
                    Well to explain it shortly, the difference between the two is that the <b>S</b> in <b>https</b> stands for <b>secure</b>
                    It just means you need a certain certificate for your url to work.
                    Which for someone like me who never really did anything web-related was some work to figure out.
                    And to get one was quite the hassle before i discovered that GitHub can do it automatically for you.
                    So i wasted 2 days of work for nothing :)

                    After that the one and only, fabled and feared..
                    sex button was added
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 4.png">
                    When you clicked it, it would close the website, was very funny.
                    <br>
                    I also added an image which my friend asked to add
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 5.png">

                    
                    And then some more images..
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 6.png">   

                    Added some styling in the form of a crt effect and colored boxes
                    also a description
                    (sex button got removed because capitalism)
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 7.png"> 
                    
                    And finally, some text styling, a TODO list, a blog section, and the famous <a href="https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Kakkakikkare" target="_blank">noita poop stone</a></h3>
                    <img src="Attachments/screenshot 8.png">

                    And that's where i am right now, first page done ^w^

                    hopefully many to come
